# mpi4py_S4S

Hi, welcome to GitHub page for the S4S on mpi4py.

To run the example programs, you will require the mpi4py module in your Python environment. This can be installed simply with

````
pip install mpi4py
````

HOWEVER, it will not install if you do not have an installation of an MPI framework (such as OpenMPI).

For those who lack an mpi implementation I think it is easiest to install with anaconda [instructions](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#using-conda).
The above instructions also include instructions for various operating systems through other methods.

See you all on Friday at 4pm.
